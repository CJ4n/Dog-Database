"# Dog-Database" 
This is an app I created for me and my brother, so everyone knows whose turn it is to walkout our dog.

App uses free sql database to keep track of whose turn it is to walkout dog and presents this data.

I deleted information about database I use for obvious reasons. Feel free to use your own database.
